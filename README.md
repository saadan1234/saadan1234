## Key Contributions

### Optical Networks and Technologies Lab (ONT Lab)
At ONT Lab, I focused on predicting the Generalized Signal-to-Noise Ratio (GSNR) by leveraging various machine learning techniques, including **Random Forest Regression, Transfer Learning, Active Learning, Knowledge Distillation**, and **Federated Learning**. My work resulted in a **Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.00002** â€” an impressive milestone in network performance prediction.

- Utilized **SHAP, LIME, ICE, and PDP** techniques for model explainability.
- Developed cutting-edge solutions to optimize network prediction models.
  
### Federated Learning Research (Undergraduate Research Assistant)
Currently, I am addressing privacy challenges in **Federated Learning (FL)** by:
- Implementing foundational FL code.
- Tackling data heterogeneity, compromised node detection, and resource optimization for edge devices.
  
### Machine Learning Internships at **CodSoft** and **InternSavy**
During my virtual internships, I developed and evaluated machine learning models for:
- **Fraud detection**  
- **Customer segmentation**  
- **Graduate admission prediction**

These internships enhanced my skills in supervised learning, model testing, and deployment.

## Education & Certifications

I am pursuing a **Bachelor of Engineering in Software Engineering** at the **National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)**. My academic background includes courses and projects focused on:
- **Deep Learning**
- **Federated Learning**

I hold certifications in **Machine Learning**, **Big Data**, and **AWS Solutions Architecture**. Additionally, I have completed **virtual internships** in Data Science and Front-End development, enriching my technical capabilities.

## Projects

### LLM Development | Python, HuggingFace, SWE-bench, RAG  
- Working on fine-tuning a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to secure a leaderboard position on **SWE-Bench**.
- Integrated **RAG** and researching Agent techniques to enhance prediction accuracy.

### Kidney Tumor Classification | Flask, AWS, Docker, GitHub Actions
- Created a classification app for kidney tumors using **VGG-16** feature extraction.
- Deployed the model on **AWS EC2** with CI/CD pipelines for real-time usage.

### OpenAI Clone | React, Node.js, OpenAI API
- Developed a chatbot and image generation feature using **GPT-3.5 turbo** and **DALL-E** models.
- Integrated community sharing for generated images and conversation history.

### SafeSteps | YOLOv8, Python, Flask
- Built a model using **YOLOv8** to detect crosswalks and validate code with **Unittest**.

## Future Aspirations

My passion lies in **AI** and **Deep Learning** research. Currently, I'm working on a **Federated Learning platform** that enhances usability and generalization to make AI accessible to a broader audience. I also look forward to contributing to AI-driven advancements in network technologies and autonomous systems.
