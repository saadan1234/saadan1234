# Hi there! I'm Muhammad Saadan, a Software Engineer.

Welcome to my **Crafting Labratory**

## Key Contributions

### Optical Networks and Technologies Lab
One of the most notable projects I have worked on involved improving the accuracy of GSNR (Generalized Signal-to-Noise Ratio) predictions. By leveraging **Machine Learning Alorithm, Transfer Learning, Active Learning, Knowledge Distillation and Federated Learning**, I was able to achieve a **mean squared error (MSE) of 0.00002**. This significant improvement in prediction accuracy is a testament to the power of machine learning in solving complex problems in network technology.

### Machine Learning Internship Experience
Before joining the Optical Networks and Technologies Lab, I had the opportunity to work as a **Machine Learning Intern** at **CodSoft** and **INTERNSAVY** as virtual internships. During these internships, I developed and tested predictive models across various domains, including:
- **Fraud detection**
- **Customer segmentation**
- **Graduate Addmission Prediction**

These experiences honed my skills in a variety of machine learning algorithms.

## Education & Certifications

I am currently pursuing a **Bachelor of Engineering** at the **National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)** as a **Software Engineer**. My academic journey has significantly strengthened my analytical capabilities, with a particular focus on:
- **Deep Learning**
- **Federated Learning**

In addition to my formal education from **National University of Sciences and Technology**, ranked number 1 in Pakistan , I have also completed certifications in **Big Data**,  **AWS** and **Machine Learning** from **Coursera**, which further solidify my expertise in these areas.

## Future Aspirations

I look forward to keep growing in the field of Deep Learning and AI. My passion lies in research and crafting practical solutions around novel approaches yet to be implemented. Currently I am working on a project regarding implementation of federated learning with enhanced usability and generalization to be available for everyone.
